# Non-relational Data Models

There have been various approaches to classify NoSQL databases, each with different categories and subcategories, some of which overlap.

A basic classification based on data model,:

* Document databases

* Graph stores

* Key-value stores

* Wide-column stores

## Document model

Document databases pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. Documents can contain many different key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents.

## Graph model

This kind of database is designed for data whose relations are well represented as a graph (elements interconnected with an undetermined number of relations between them). The kind of data could be social relations, public transport links, road maps or network topologies, for example.

Graph stores are used to store information about networks, such as social connections. Graph stores include Neo4J and HyperGraphDB.

## Key-value model

Key-value stores are the simplest NoSQL databases. Every single item in the database is stored as an attribute name (or "key"), together with its value. Examples of key-value stores are Riak and Voldemort. Some key-value stores, such as Redis, allow each value to have a type, such as "integer", which adds functionality.

## Wide-column model

Wide-column stores such as Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large datasets, and store columns of data together, instead of rows.
