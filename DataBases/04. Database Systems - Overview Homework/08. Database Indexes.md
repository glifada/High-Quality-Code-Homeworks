## Database Indexes

## Advantages

* Database indexes help speed up retrieval of data.

* Server doesn't have to work as hard to get the data.

* They are providing the database with quick jump points on where to find the full reference (or to find the database row).



## Disadvantages

* They can take up quite a bit of space - check a textbook or reference guide and you'll see it takes quite a few pages to include those page references.

* Using too many indexes can actually slow your database down.

* Each time a database row is updated or removed, the reference or index also has to be updated.


So indexes speed up finding data, but slow down inserting, updating or deleting data.

Some fields are automatically indexed. A primary key or a field marked as 'unique' - for example an email address, a userid or a social security number - are automatically indexed so the database can quickly check to make sure that you're not going to introduce bad data.
