# SQL Language

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard interactive and programming language. SQL is used to communicate with a database. It's aim is to store, manipulate, and query data stored in relational databases

According to ANSI (American National Standards Institute), it is the standard language for relational database management systems.

SQL statements are used to perform tasks such as update data on a database, or retrieve data from a database.

Some common relational database management systems that use SQL are: Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft SQL Server, Access, Ingres, etc. Although most database systems use SQL, most of them also have their own additional proprietary extensions that are usually only used on their system. However, the standard SQL commands such as "Select", "Insert", "Update", "Delete", "Create", and "Drop" can be used to accomplish almost everything that one needs to do with a database.
